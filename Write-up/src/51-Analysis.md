##Measuring success
The main way of measuring a project's success, as previously stated, is through how well it adheres to its initial requirements. Previously, a set of MoSCoW requirements were outlined (see [Requirements](#Construction-3-1)), and it was stated that the project would be considered a success if the Must-Have and Should-Have requirements were all met. The best way to check this is to go over these requirements again.

It can be seen here that all the requirements for the project's success were met, and therefore by definition the project must and will be considered a success. Due in particular to the setbacks encountered with the failed hard disk, however, not all the Could-Have requirements were met. The project was a success but some of the desirable features that would have been nice to implement didn't make it in.
