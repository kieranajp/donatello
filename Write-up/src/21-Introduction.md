##Introduction
There is a problem with the current systems of content delivery. The current methods fail to work for people and their hectic lifestyles. As physical media's scarcity increases and more and more rental stores shut down - even large chains such as Blockbuster have been shutting several retail outlets - the world seems to be moving steadily towards digital content distribution. However, many current use cases for these services are flawed.

The purchase of 1080p movies or modern PC games - both files which would likely exceed 10GB in size - over the internet, is common. However, the issue is that these files can often take a large amount of time to download, particularly on connections with lower bandwidth. And on these connections, streaming of movies becomes almost impossible too - a stream with too-low bandwidth will often stutter, providing a poor viewing experience. This project proposes a solution to this problem, not by decreasing download times but by taking an alternative approach to this whole workflow of content delivery. The solution will be in the form of a software product which will allow files to be downloaded without any user intervention required at the PC the file ends up on. Downloads could instead be instantiated remotely, through a web interface or even mobile app.

###Objectives
The objective, then, is to develop an application that allows the above. The application will be developed in two parts: one part to initiate the download and the other part to process it. As the initiation of the download is meant to be possible from *anywhere*, there are two ways this part of the application could be done. The first way would be to create a website that allows the purchase of products that will download on the target PC. The other method would be the creation of a web service or API (Application Programming Interface) to allow third-party web stores (or mobile apps, or desktop applications, or any sort of program) to perform actions through the created system. For this part of the project, the decision has been made to go with the latter

The main objective is to develop a system that provides a means of developing and comparing different AI algorithms to solve a particular problem. How successful I am at this will be assessed based on three things:

It’s ability to test different AI algorithm’s performance at a problem fairly
The versatility in what different AI algorithms can be implemented
The number of different AI algorithms implemented
How level the playing field is for the test
How well the system can be used to judge the relative effectiveness of each AI algorithm.
How usable the data is to make an informed decision about each algorithm’s effectiveness
How easily large numbers of tests can be ran and compared
The overall effectiveness of the AI algorithm rated best by the system.
Simply see how well the ‘chosen’ AI algorithm actually solves the problem

###Intended Learning Outcomes
<pre>
AI Algorithms

I have no previous experience with AI so by the end of this project I hope to have learnt not only how AI is implemented in terms of problem solving and decision making, but also some actual techniques and algorithms used by AI Applications.

Simulators/Test Beds

I have had limited experience with using a software sandbox to model the outcome of scenarios or configurations (such as networking tools and HTML/CSS testing) but no experience with creating one myself so I hope to learn of the problems (technical or practical) involved in developing such a tool and ideally their solutions too.</pre>
