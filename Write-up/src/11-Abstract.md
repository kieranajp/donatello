*This project attempts to address the problem of having to wait for downloads while on a slow connection or when time is an issue by providing a software system, Donatello, which evades this issue. It proposes a new way of delivering digital content, specifically large files such as video games and high-definition movies, over the internet to a user's computer without any human interaction at the receiving end. This is achieved by providing a system allowing downloads to be initiated on one computer and downloaded on another. The user is able to make purchases through websites or mobile apps (made by hypothetical third-parties) which will utilise an API to send messages to a remote computer, where the download will occur. In this way, a consumer is able to get their content onto their preferred computer while not being at it - therefore allowing the download to process while they are performing other tasks, and allowing them to be able to return to their computer some time later in the knowledge that their content is ready to enjoy.*

*Largely influenced by Steam and other digital media stores, and inspired by real-life issues, the application was developed over a period of just a few weeks by a single developer as part of a university dissertation for a Computing undergraduate course. Its design ideologies and development process are documented and critically evaluated here in this document, alongside a critical evaluation of trusted academic sources on related topics.*
