		*	Development methodologies  
			*	Explanation, evaluation, choice  
			* Why use them?  
			* provide structure - greater chance of overall project success  
			* lifecycle is not a design, modelling or diagramming technique  
			* works best if viewed as a framework rather than followed strictly  
			* History on SDLCs - 1970s pure waterfall  
				* document driven  
				* all planning done up-front  
				* phases of waterfall - linear approach - no overlapping phases  
					1. Requirements spec  
					2. Design  
					3. Construction (i.e. implementation)  
					4. Integration   
					5. Testing & debugging  
					6. Installation  
					7. Maintenance  
				* Works well for projects with:  
					* stable product definition  
					* well-understood technologies  
					* quality constraints stronger than cost & schedule  
					* technically weak staff  
					* provides structure  
					* good for overseas projects  
				* Limitations:  
					* rigid march from start to finish (inflexible)  
					* difficult to fully define requirements up-front  
					* can produce excessive documentation  
					* few visible signs of progress until the end  
					* integration & testing occur at the end  
					* often first chance to "see" the program  
  		    
  		  * So many different SDLCs - different projects need to follow a different framework  
  		  * How phases of other lifecycles compare to pure waterfall  
  		  * Created to provide standardised way of producing projects. Improve focus, efficiency and productivity.  
  		  * Consider 2-3 SDLCs to evaluate (e.g. waterfall, v model, spiral, agile (DSDM, FDD, scrum, eXtreme Programming etc))

  		    * agile - iterative and incremental  
  		      * conduct testing during development  
  		      * unit testing - developer's perspective  
  		      * acceptance testing - end user's perspective  
  		      * end user and developer are in close communication  
  		      * not good for projects with:  
  		        * more than 20 developers  
  		        * distributed teams (e.g. in offshoring/global software development)  
  		      * PROS: (similar to XP)  
  		        * can reduce process overhead  
  		        * responsive to user feedback  
  		        * amendable to change  
  		      * CONS:  
  		        * require close monitoring by project manager  
  		        * may not scale to large projects  
  		        * often requires better quality developers  
  		    * eXtreme Programming (XP)
