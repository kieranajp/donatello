#Review of Trusted Sources
	Notes
	-----
	* As networks and the Internet have come about and improved, the way people get their content has and continues to change
	* In the same way as people no longer really go to record stores, instead using iTunes etc., the way people get other digital content is too evolving
	* Software is almost never bought on CD anymore, instead downloaded - app stores are the most recent thing
	* Movies are now commonly available to download through iTunes, NetFlix etc. too, and streaming services are often available
	* Similarly the rise of Steam, D2D allow you to download video games direct to your PC

The speed, and the convenience, of networks in recent years - the prevalence of wireless networking and the omnipresence of the Internet - has lent itself to the way people obtain and subsequently consume their content. Major news corporations - the BBC, Sky, CNN, and so on - have been widespread across the Web for many years, and many Web users prefer to get their news through these sources rather than through traditional means such as television channels or newspapers. In the same way, people frequent record stores less and less. The early 21st century brought around Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks for downloading files such as Napster and Kazaa, and shortly thereafter came the iTunes Store. Likewise for movies and TV shows - high street store chains selling such media have been dwindling in recent years as more and more people turn to purchasing content online, or using streaming services. And similarly once more for games.

Games-on-demand have actually been around for longer than their Video (VOD) counterparts - indeed the first games available for digital distribution came about in 1983 with the GameLine rental service for the Atari 2600. In contrast, the first VOD service didn't come about until late 1994. While today, most of the kinks in the modern variants of these services (Steam, the Xbox Live Marketplace or Netflix to name a few) have been worked out, allowing these services to provide a clean, easy and fast user experience (UX), the services have yet to take on fully widespread adoption in the same way as, say, the iTunes Music Store has (which became the largest music retailer in the United States in 2008). A factor of this problem may in fact have something to do with one of the causes of services' prevalence: the recent boom in the speed of the Internet.

Or, more precisely, the boom in the speed of the Internet *in most areas*. To use an example, while devices sporting 3G or 4G radios are easily capable of downloading data at incredibly high speeds even over the air, this is on the proviso that the radio is in an area with good signal coverage. Similarly with home broadband connections - while connection speeds are in many areas fast enough to, say, download a HD movie in a reasonable amount of time, or stream it with any level of quality of service, in other households with lesser connections downloading can become an overnight affair, and streaming can be completely out of the question. Obtaining our media through the Internet, and not in physical form, is undoubtedly the future. Just in some places, infrastructures aren't ready for the future yet.

As technology in content distribution hurtles further and further towards streaming services the quality and bandwidth of the internet connection in question becomes more and more important. Even streaming services for gaming have made an appearance recently - OnLive is a service allowing 'cloud gaming', streaming the output and input in realtime to and from a thin client, that became available to the public in 2010. Once again, perfectly brilliant with any reasonable amount of connectivity and wholly unusable on lower-end connections. 

In the United Kingdom, a recent study found that over a third of the country are suffering with these sub-par broadband speeds - this being defined by "under 5Mb/s". And this is even
